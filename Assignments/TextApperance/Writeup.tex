\section{My Opinion}

I mean no disrespect I just wanted to vent here.

\vspace{2cm}

I am publicly vocal about my opion on \textbf{propriatary languages}. And while it is true that C\# has recently become open source i am still dissapointed
at every corner by the language.

Its not that I do not understand it, im fluent in both java and C\# and i mean no disrespect to you by submitting this in python. I will try and write
this assignment properly in C\# the moment I can, because i am behind.

I just wish to voice what i think about C\#, and my complaints, the overall workflow, the clunky package management. Its so bloated, unweildy, overwhelming.
Languages like Java, C\#, Pearl, these languages used in industry are not used productivly. I try and get by but Im simply not geared for this, at every
corner even just using winforms witch is \textbf{windows propriatary}, or the alternative gtk libraries. Its just so frustrating.

You cant even load a json without a build system, a dedicated windows packager or an IDE.
